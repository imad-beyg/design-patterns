# Design Patterns in PHP
A design pattern is a common solution to a common problem. Nothing more, nothing less. And, while some of these approaches might seem foreign or overwhelming to you, the important thing to remember is that, as a developer, you are in charge. That means you decide when a pattern is appropriate, and when it's completely unnecessary. That's the key.

### 1. The Decorator Pattern
A decorator allows us to dynamically extend the behavior of a particular object at runtime, without needing to resort to unnecessary inheritance. Let me give you a demonstration.
